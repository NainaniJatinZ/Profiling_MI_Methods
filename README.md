# Profiling_MI_Methods

I am a researcher facing a lot of issue with memory when doing Mech Interp at scale. This library is made to memory and time profile different methods and libraries used in Mech Interp. Primary model will probably be gpt2-small for the beginning. Planning to use llama3-8b for larger experiments. 

TODOS:

Libraries: 
- [ ] nnsight
  - [ ] Activation Patching
  - [ ] Attribution Patching
  - [ ] SAE

- [ ] transformerLens
  - [ ] Activation Patching
  - [ ] Attribution Patching
  - [ ] SAE

- [ ] EluetherAI
  - [ ] SAE 

- [ ] will add more as suggested

Hardware:
- [ ] M3 Pro
- [ ] a100
- [ ] rtx8000
- [ ] titanx
- [ ] cpu only


This repo will also help me understand the inner workings of the methods and how various researchers are optimizing their experiments. I plan to put out all my findings in this repo. Hopefully it benefits someone else too!
